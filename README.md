# Advanced-Vehicle-Detection-and-Classification-A-Deep-Learning-Approach-with-High-Precision


The "Vehicle-Detection-and-Classification system" presented in this project aims to accurately detect and count vehicles on highways using computer vision techniques and deep learning models. Here's a summary of the key components and steps involved:

Introduction: 
The system utilizes the YOLOv3 network for vehicle detection and the ORB algorithm for tracking vehicle trajectories. The goal is to address the challenge of detecting and counting vehicles of various sizes on highways.

Installation:
To set up the system, one needs to clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip.

Usage:
The system comprises code files for vehicle detection, counting, and trajectory tracking, along with input files (images or videos) on which the detection and counting will be performed.

Dataset:
The project includes a high-definition highway vehicle dataset containing 328K images with annotated tiny objects for training deep learning models. This dataset serves as a foundation for training models tailored for highway vehicle detection.

License: 
The project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, with more information available in the LICENSE file.

Overall, the system offers a comprehensive solution for detecting and counting vehicles on highways, leveraging computer vision techniques and deep learning models trained on a specialized dataset.
